DESCRIPTION : This project shows how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model learns to identify digits 0-9 from grayscale 28x28 pixels images. CNNs are a robust form of neural network particularly well-suited for image classification problems because they have an innate ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features in a process called backpropagation.

This project includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

CNN architecture construction

Model compilation and training

Model evaluation

Visualization of training and validation performance

Tools Used Tools Use case Python programming language used for implementation Tensorflow library used to build and train CNN Keras to download dataset and model building Matplotlib for plotting accuracy and loss graphs VS code/jupyter for running and experimenting code Dataset : The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images:

60,000 for training

10,000 for testing

each image is a 28x28 pixel square representing a single digit from 0 to 9

Model Details The architecture of CNN used in this task consists of the following layers:

1.Conv2D Layer(32 filters,3x3 kernel,ReLU activation) – Conscientious to learn simple edges and textures.

2.MaxPooling2D Layer – Used to reduce dimensionality and computation.

3.Conv2D Layer(64 filters,x3 kernel,ReLU activation) – Conscientious to learn complicated features and patterns.

4.MaxPooling2D Layer – Further reduces the dimensionality.

5.Flatten Layer – Converts 2D feature maps to a 1D vector for fully connected layers.

6.Dense Layer (64 units,ReLU activation) – Hidden layer for learning non-linear combinations of features.

7.Dense Output Layer (10 units,Softmax activation) – Outputs probability distribution over 10 digit classes.

Compilation & Training Details Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy – employed since we have integer-labeled classes.

Optimizer: adam – a self-adaptive optimizer that works well in practice.

Metrics: accuracy – measures how frequently predictions equal labels.

Batch Size: 32 – how many samples are handled at a time before the model is updated.

Epochs: 4 – how many times the model passes over the whole training set.

Evaluation & Results The model is tested after training using the test set. The test gives:

Test accuracy: Final model accuracy on new test data.

Test loss: Average loss on the test dataset.

The performance is plotted with Matplotlib to see:

Training vs Validation accuracy

Training vs Validation loss

Applications Handwritten digit recognition

Object recognition in images

CNNs can be used in various fields for pattern recognition

CNNs can be used to detect and classify traffic signals

Conclusion This project showcases how CNNs are designed to work with image data efficiently and demonstrates their strength in recognizing visual patterns.
